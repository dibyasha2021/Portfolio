## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  


## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or while just having fun with data and code.

### advanced ab testing course
**Description:** Advanced A/B testing course by [karpov.courses](https://karpov.courses/simulator-ab). 
This self-paced course explores such topics as Basics of Statistics, Hypothesis testing, Experimental design, Design testing, Confidence intervals, Improving test sensitivity, Metric selection, Cuped, Stratification, Multiple testing, Traffic splitting, Analysis of ratio metrics (Linearization and Delta Method) and a Complete A/B testing pipeline. All with an extensive coding practice in Python.
**Repository:** Check the repository having my solutions on Advanced A/B testing course tasks and challenges ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/ab_testing_advanced_course)  
**Status:** Completed in June 2023 (please, check the certificates section below).  
 

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
- [Advanced A/B Testing Course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rGfXuVLWLkxzrPLE-NgHizMN-tpoZibA/view) (Jun 2023) (karpov.courses)
